# euler-oiler
A compilation of solutions to Euler problems - an effort to practice my skills in problem solving/maths, as well as forming the maximally efficient programmatic implementation of the solutions to these problems.

Also a way for me to continue using C# code and Git VCS while I explore other things in the 9-5 realm.
